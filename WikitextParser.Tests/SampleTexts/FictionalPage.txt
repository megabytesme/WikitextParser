'''''Eerie Hollow''''' is a fictional American television series created by [[The Weaver Siblings]] for [[StreamVerse]]. Produced by Midnight Pictures, the first season was released on July 15, 2023. The second and third seasons followed in October 2024 and July 2025, respectively. A fourth season was released in two parts in May and July 2026.

Set in the 1990s, the series centers on the residents of the fictional town of Whisper Creek, [[Oregon]], after a nearby government facility opens a gateway to a hostile alternate dimension known as "the Other Side". The ensemble cast includes Jane Doe, John Smith, Finn Fish, and Millie Brown.

The Weaver Siblings developed ''Eerie Hollow'' as a mix of investigative drama and supernatural elements, infusing references to the pop culture of the 1990s. Thematic elements were inspired by the works of director Marcus Vance and author Arthur Croft.

==Plot Overview==
''Eerie Hollow'' is set in the fictional town of Whisper Creek, Oregon, in the 1990s. The nearby Whisper Creek National Laboratory ostensibly performs research for the government but secretly experiments with the paranormal, inadvertently creating a portal to the Other Side.

The first season begins in November 1993, when Leo Vance is abducted by a creature from the Other Side. His mother, Sarah, and Police Chief Brody search for him. A young psychokinetic girl named Zeta escapes from the laboratory and is found by Leo's friends, who she helps in their search.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fictional Article One |url=http://example.com/1 }}</ref>
